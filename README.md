• data/ – Raw and processed datasets. This includes the original data files (e.g.,Data_LouisBolk_soil-moisture-study_v1_Oct2024.xlsx and v2_Nov2024.xlsx) and derived datasets (such as the merged 2019–2023 dry matter yield dataset in CSV format) used for analysis.


• scripts/ – R scripts for data preprocessing, modeling, and figure generation.Each script is dedicated to a specific task (data cleaning and transformation, statistical model fitting, diagnostic checks, visualization, etc.), allowing step-by-step replication of the analysis.


• figures/ – Exported figures used in the thesis. These high-resolution images correspond to all plots presented in the results, such as boxplots of yield, interaction effect plots, correlation heatmaps, and diagnostic graphs.


• outputs/ – Final combined datasets and intermediate outputs. For example,outputs from sensitivity analyses (e.g., a “leave-one-year-out” analysis results CSV), or processed data ready for modeling, are stored here. These files illustrate the results of transformations or analyses that were too detailed for the main text.
